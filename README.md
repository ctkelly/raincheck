The guilt-free plan cancelling app for introverts.❤️

Have you ever had plans with a friend, but were perhaps in need of downtime, and secretly hoping 
your friend needed some downtime too and wanted to cancel your get-together? This app is for you!

If you want to cancel plans you've made with someone, you click on the "Request raincheck" button for that event. 
If the other person also clicks their button for that event, then your plans are "rainchecked" and you both get notified
by email. However, if only one person clicks "Request raincheck" then your plans remain in place and the other person
never finds out you wanted to cancel.

Thanks to my BFF Kathy for this great idea.
