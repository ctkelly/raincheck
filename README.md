The guilt-free plan cancelling app for introverts.❤️

The idea for this app (my first Django project) came from a conversation with 
my BFF Kathy (a fellow introvert!)

Kathy: I saw the best idea on Instagram. Someone posted that there should be an app where if you 
want to cancel plans you've made with someone, you click on a button. If the other person clicks 
their button too, then yay, your plans are cancelled and you both get notified by email! But if only 
one person clicks their button, then your plans remain in place and the other person never finds 
out you wanted to cancel. 

Me: Wow, what a great idea...I should try making that app!
