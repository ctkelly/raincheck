The guilt-free plan cancelling app for introverts. ❤️

The idea for this app (my first Django project) came from a conversation with 
my BFF Kathy (a fellow introvert!)

Kathy: I saw a great idea on Instagram! Someone suggested there should be an app where if you 
want to cancel plans you've made with someone, you click on a button. If the other person clicks 
their button too, then yay, your plans are cancelled and you both get some downtime! But if only 
one person clicks their button, then your plans remain in place and the other person never finds 
out you wanted to cancel. 

Me: I love it!  

Later I thought, "I should try making that." 

As an added feature, I used the Django REST framework as well as JavaScript fetch() for the first time -- 
so if both friends are logged in at the same time and one had previously clicked the "request raincheck" button
and then the second friend clicks theirs, they get a pop-up notification in the browser saying that their plans 
have been rainchecked.
